    "## Initial Information:\n",
    "### Data:\n",
    "- Additive materials (Bulk and Wire) + timestamps\n",
    "- Heating times and power usage\n",
    "- Temp readings + timestamps\n",
    "- Inert Gas usage  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions:\n",
    "**Question:** Is any of the data not immediately available during production?  \n",
    "**Response:** Intermediate temperatures cannot be used in the model, the sensors are unable to quickly determine these temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:**  For the Bulk materials and wire, are the NaNs unknown values or the automatic value for when that material wasn't used?  \n",
    "**Response:** When the material wasn't used  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Plan:\n",
    "1. Isolate the target variable into its own series.\n",
    "2. Remove date-time variables after deriving a duration variable from electrode data\n",
    "3. Merge remaining data into a single dataframe where each iteration is only one row.  \n",
    "4. Build a variety of Regression models and test them\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution:  \n",
    "- We stuck to the plan for the most part.  \n",
    "- We completely removed the timestamps for the bulk, wire, and electrode data.  \n",
    "- Isolated the target variable and merged the remaining data into one dataframe.\n",
    "- Our biggest deviation from the plan was calculating the entire process duration instead of the heating duration  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- Seperating the first and and final temp readings for each iteration was the trickier but most crucial part of the process\n",
    "- After that merging the data was the final hurdle but was simplified by having a key column to merge on  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- We tested 3 models against a dummy model to try and find the best one:  \n",
    "    1. Linear Regression\n",
    "    2. CatBoost Regressor\n",
    "    3. Ridge\n",
    "- The dummy model (sanity test) scored just over an 8 MAE\n",
    "- Linear Regression and Ridge performed adequately with MAE scores just under 6\n",
    "- We tried CatBoost with some parameter tuning and the basic format - the base model performed better  \n"
